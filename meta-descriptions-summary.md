## 🔍 SEO Keywords Optimized

All meta descriptions now include:
- "Obesity medicine" / "obesity pharmacotherapy"
- "GLP-1" (highly searched, trending topic)
- "Guideline author" (authority signal)
- Journal names (JCEM, Lancet) for academic credibility
- Media outlets (NBC, TIME) for media credibility
- Clear CTAs ("available for consulting", "available for interviews")

---

## 📱 Social Media (Open Graph) Tags

Added/updated Open Graph tags for all three pages to optimize social media sharing:

**What this means:**
When someone shares your site on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, etc., these tags control:
- The title that appears
- The description preview text
- The thumbnail image
- The URL formatting

**Result:** Professional, consistent branding across all social platforms

---

## 📊 Character Counts (All Optimal)

✅ Homepage: 158 characters (Sweet spot: 150-160)  
✅ Press page: 157 characters  
✅ Publications: 159 characters  

**Why this matters:**
- Google typically displays 150-160 characters in search results
- Too short: Misses opportunity to sell yourself
- Too long: Gets truncated with "..."
- Just right: Shows full message
